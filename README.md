# Workout Manager

## Staying Healthy and Organized


**What will the application do?**
This Workout Manager will provide users to create their own collection of different workouts. Each workout will allow 
users to add multiple exercises with repetitions for each exercise to a specific workout. In addition, they can set and 
change a level of their workouts to one of: *Beginners, Intermediate, or Advanced*. It will keep track of all the 
workouts the user has created, and details of the exercises within each of their workouts. Features of the workout 
manager include: listing all the exercises within a workout, listing all the workouts in a collection, and setting
the level of each workout in the user's collection. 

**Who will use it?**
Anyone who is active, whether they are beginning their workout journey or for people who are more advanced.
This will be beneficial for people starting out on their fitness journey and for those individuals that prefer to 
plan out their workouts. It will allow users to organize their workouts and different exercises based on their specific 
workout goal at that time. 

**Why is this project of interest to you?**
This project is of interest to me because I want to personally be able to use this application. Since quarantine has 
begun, I noticed that I was not feeling my best mentally and physically. Thus, I decided to start investing in my 
health. When I first started out, it was really difficult for me to get into the routine of working out by myself and 
not in a gym with various equipment to use, where I would mainly utilize the treadmill and other weight machines. I had 
to research and learn how to motivate myself to fulfill the recommended physical activity per day.
I feel that making a workout manager based on the users' personal fitness goals will motivate them to go and 
complete the work out for the day. It allows the user to not have to worry about planning their workouts and motivates 
them to stay active when they are feeling lazy or tired.
