# Workout Schedule

## Staying Healthy At Home


**What will the application do?**
This application will provide users to create their own workout guides with different workout goals. Each workout goal
will allow users to add exercises and repetitions of exercises to their workout. In addition, they can add a level
of their workouts: *Beginners, Intermediates, or Advanced*. They can check off their exercises as either complete or 
incomplete and get a list of exercises in that workout that have yet to be completed.

**Who will use it?**
Anyone who is active, whether they are beginning their workout journey or for people who are more advanced.
This will be beneficial for people starting out on their fitness journey and for those individuals that prefer to 
plan for their workouts for the week.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**
This project is of interest to me because I want to personally be able to use this application. Since quarantine has 
begun, I noticed that I was not feeling my best mentally and physically. Thus, I decided to start investing in my 
health. When I first started out, it was really difficult for me to get into the routine of working out by myself and 
not in a gym with various equipment to use, where I would mainly utilize the treadmill and other weight machines. I had 
to research and learn how to motivate myself to get the recommended one hour of physical activity every day.
I feel that making a workout agenda based on the users' personal fitness goals will motivate them to go and 
complete the work out for that day of the week. It allows the user to not have to think about and pushes them to stay
active when they are feeling lazy or tired.
